Alsalam Alaykum wa rahmat Allahi wa Barakatuh.
Welcome to the world's first halal search engine built with kids in mind. Hilal is designed to allow kids to explore the internet without all of the unnessacary and haram content that is found on the web. 

# What makes Hilal special?

2. Multilingual support: We cater to a diverse audience by offering our search engine in multiple languages, including Arabic, English, Urdu, and French.
3. Clean and simple design: Keeping your children safe doesn't need to look boring. With Hilal, the design of everything is simple and clean.

# We encourage you to:
